Big data framework(s) you plan to use: Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Spark



Short description (theme) of your application (in no more than five sentences): This project aims to identify rotten fruits using computer vision. We plan on using Hadoop ManReduce to extract features from the fruit images dataset and use Apache Spark train a neutral network to classify fruits as fresh/rotten. To enable scalability, fault tolerance, and parallelization, we intend to use a distributed computation architecture.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup (Windows PowerShell)

Before running any script, you must set PySpark to use your Python 3.11 interpreter:

```powershell
$env:PYSPARK_PYTHON = (py -3.11 -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)")
$env:PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON = $env:PYSPARK_PYTHON

## üß© Steps to Run

### Manifest csv

```powershell
py code\manifest.py

### Feature Extraction

```powershell
py code\extract_features.py
